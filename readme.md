# Follow Me!

![Follow Me!](/assets/Screenshot.png "Follow Me!")

This JavaScript code implements a memory game where players need to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds. The game starts by illuminating a sequence of squares in a specific order, and the player must replicate the sequence correctly to proceed to the next level. Each level increases the length of the sequence, challenging the player's memory skills.
